# DOM-Based Focus Management Implementation

This implementation follows Christopher's suggestion to create a visible DOM element for the MultiselectDraggable that can hold browser focus, addressing the focus management issues in Blockly v12.

## Key Changes

### 1. Visual Selection Outline
- Added a rectangular outline around all selected items (similar to Google Slides)
- The outline is a visible SVG element that can receive browser focus
- Styled with dashed border and proper focus indicators

### 2. DOM Focus Management
- `getFocusableElement()` now returns the actual DOM element (`selectionOutline_`)
- Added proper `tabindex="0"` and accessibility attributes
- Implemented keyboard event handling for accessibility

### 3. Real-time Updates
- Outline position and size updates automatically when:
  - Items are added/removed from selection
  - Items are dragged
  - Selection changes
- Visual feedback when gaining/losing focus

### 4. Integration with Existing System
- All existing `updateFocusedNode()` calls now trigger outline visibility
- Added `onBecomeFocused()` method to ensure outline is shown
- Proper cleanup in `dispose()` method

## Technical Details

### Visual Elements
- **Container**: `.blocklyMultiselectOutline` - Transparent container
- **Outline**: `.blocklyMultiselectOutlineRect` - Focusable dashed rectangle
- **Styling**: Blue dashed border (#4285f4) with rounded corners

### Focus States
- **Normal**: 2px dashed border
- **Focused**: 3px border with enhanced visibility
- **Hover**: Reduced opacity for better UX

### Accessibility
- Proper `role="button"` and `aria-label`
- Keyboard navigation support (Enter, Space, Escape)
- Focus indicators follow web accessibility standards

## Benefits

1. **Solves v12 Focus Issues**: Provides a real DOM element that focus manager can work with
2. **Visual Feedback**: Users can clearly see what's selected
3. **Accessibility**: Screen readers and keyboard navigation work properly
4. **Backward Compatible**: Doesn't break existing functionality

## Usage

The implementation is automatic - when multiple blocks are selected:
1. The outline appears around the selection
2. The outline can receive focus from the focus manager
3. Users can interact with it via keyboard or mouse
4. The outline updates in real-time during operations

This follows the recommended approach (2) from Ben's suggestions and implements Christopher's DOM element idea successfully.
